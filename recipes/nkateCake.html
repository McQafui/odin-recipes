<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nkate cake is a crunchy nougat made from roasted peanuts.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb peanuts (unsalted)</li>
    <li>½ small lemon</li>
    <li>½ small lemon</li>
    <li>1 cup caster sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 320 F / 160 C.</li>
    <li>Spread the raw peanuts evenly on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven and roast the peanuts for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the peanuts cool completely.</li>
    <li>Spread the peanuts on a cutting board and crush them with a rolling pin.</li>
    <li>Pour the sugar into a non-stick pan and add the water and a few drops of lemon juice.</li>
    <li>Cook the sugar over medium heat and let it dissolve until it reaches a temperature of 320 F / 160 C on a candy thermometer</li>
    <li>At this point, the sugar syrup should be light in color.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed peanuts to the sugar syrup.</li>
    <li>Stir vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes over low heat.</li>
    <li>Spread the mixture on a previously oiled cutting board (or between 2 sheets of parchment paper) and use a rolling pin to flatten it to a thickness of about ⅓ inch (6 mm)</li>
    <li>Using a large sharp knife, make slight incisions of 2-inch (5 cm) squares very quickly while the mixture is still hot. Operate very quickly before it hardens.</li>
    <li>Once the nkate cake has cooled, cut the precut pieces along the cut lines.</li>
</ol>
